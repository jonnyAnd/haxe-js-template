# haxe-js-template


A simple base for a Haxe JS pixi project.
Easy starting point for quick games. 


Install Haxe as per the instructions Here: http://haxe.org/download/
Then install the pixi haxe externs with '$haxelib install pixijs'

Then its just '$haxe build.hxml' to build the project.

Warning, by the time you get to this project, the included pixiJS may be out of date, i would check for a newer version if i were you.
